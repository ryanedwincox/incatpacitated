LAPCAT - Comic Strip Concept

Panel 1:
Ryan is on the far left, Helen in the middle, and the couch is coming into
view on the right side of the frame. They're walking towards the couch.
Ryan says: "You know, there's only one cat that likes laps more than Turtle."
Helen looks curious.

Panel 2:
Ryan is standing in front of the couch next to Helen. John the cat is curled
up on Ryan's lap area even though he's still standing. Ryan is looking down
at the cat. Helen is looking and pointing at the cat. Ryan says: "It's John."
Helen says: "You haven't even sat down yet."
