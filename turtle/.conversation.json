    "content": "Here's the generated image of Turtle curled up in a ball. It follows the ultra-minimal style with clean black lines on white, closed eyes for sleeping, and a nice round curled-up shape. The style is fairly consistent with the loaf reference - same minimal line approach, though the eyes are curved lines (closed) rather than dots.\n\nA few notes:\n- The ears are slightly more pointed/angular than the rounder loaf reference\n- The nose uses small curved lines rather than a single dot\n- The tail wraps around nicely to complete the ball shape\n\nWould you like me to regenerate with any adjustments, or would you like me to convert this to SVG?\n",
