So the speech bubble tail should be pointed to the right side of the page and be located on the right side of the page. Ryan is sitting on the couch whistling. He's looking left then right? Then left in the first three panels to give a little variation and change the number of and style of music and notes in each panel. And then in the last panel Ryan is lying on the couch with turtle and loaf position on his chest and it's the person off the screen saying I'm ready from the right side again and Ryan is saying I'm not",

    "content": "Here's the updated comic concept. The key changes:\n\n**Panels 1-3** - Helen is the one speaking from off-screen right (not Ryan). All her speech bubbles are positioned on the right side with tails pointing off the right edge of the panel. Meanwhile Ryan is just sitting on the couch whistling:\n- **Panel 1**: Ryan looking LEFT, single \u266a note\n- **Panel 2**: Ryan looking RIGHT, two notes \u266a \u266b\n- **Panel 3**: Ryan looking LEFT again, three notes \u266b \u266a \u266b\n\n**Panel 4** - The punchline: Ryan is now lying down on the couch with Turtle in loaf position on his chest. Helen says \"I'm ready!\" (from off-screen right again), and Ryan replies \"I'm not\" \u2014 pinned down by the cat.\n\nDoes this look good to you, or would you like any changes before we start generating the panels?\n",
