Comparing to the previous version:\n\n- **Mustache**: He now has the light mustache/stubble dots around his mouth area\n- **Flatter hat**: The crown of the baseball cap sits noticeably lower and flatter on his head compared to v2\n- **Face**: Slightly more angular jawline\n\nThe style is consistent with the existing references - clean black and white line art, same uniform stroke width. Turtle the cat looks good too - nice and round.\n\nA couple things I notice that might need tweaking:\n- The stubble/dots might be a bit heavy - there are dots on the chin area too, not just above the lip. Would you prefer it to be just a subtle mustache line above the upper lip only?\n- The line weight looks slightly thicker than the older refs\n\nWant me to iterate on anything, or does this look like a good direction? I can also convert to SVG if you'd like.\n",
